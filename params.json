I know my way around a database, and I’ve had experience in system administration to boot. I first started learning how to code when I was an early teenager, first picking up the basic stuff like HTML and CSS, then later on Javascript and PHP. When I wanted to make dynamic websites, I learned how to use PHP and AJAX techniques.\r\n\r\n### Experiences\r\nFor the past few years I have been refining my skills as a web developer. Working freelance from an early age has given me a tremendous leap in my skill set. I started attending Northeastern University in the fall of 2011, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I did an internship at Novartis in Cambridge, MA as a front-end developer working in Javascript in the summer of 2012. In the spring of 2013 I worked at Compete, a digital marketing company in Boston. My ultimate goal is to turn my greatest hobby into a lifelong career.\r\n\r\n### What I do\r\nI'm involved in a few long-term projects, spanning a wide array of interests. My long-term goal is to create an browser-based persistent strategy game. I have actually created several, but when a new technology or idea comes along, I do not hesitate to start over.\r\n\r\nIn order to learn Python, I started a 2D map generation project with the goal of creating life-like randomized world maps. I explored erosion algorithms, diamond-square and Perlin noise, river generation, and even climate models. These complex algorithms led me to explore performance optimization. My next goal is to find an efficient algorithm to randomly generate political boundaries.\r\n\r\nThis map generation project is similar to another one of my projects. I have been interested in creating a realistic simulation of space, complete with stars and planets, explorable using HTML5 canvas. To do this I researched NASA statistics on stars and planet formations and variations. This would be the largest HTML5 project I would attempt. However, I quickly ran into memory issues, requiring a scaling back on my ambitions somewhat. Still, it's quite interesting working in such an emerging technology.\r\n\r\nMy other projects include an abstract database-agnostic admin panel framework, a websocket Node.js wrapper, and a random name generation library using Markov chains.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n**Email:** me@kaelan.org",
